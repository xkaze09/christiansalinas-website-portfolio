# Christian Salinas Website Portfolio
 I'm someone who aspires to grow with technology. But, I never had the chance to make my very own portfolio website, even though I have experience in developing static to dynamic websites. With that, I take this opportunity to be able to make my very own portfolio to show online with the help of Bootstrap and GitHub Pages. The purpose of doing so is for me to be able to track and further expand my achievements, skills, goals, and status.
 
 Christian Salinas Website Portfolio is submitted as a final project requirement to CMSC 10 with Sir Jenmarc Muchada as the Instructor.
