# Christian Salinas Website Portfolio
 I'm someone who aspires to grow with technology. But, I never had the chance to make my very own portfolio website, even though I have experience in developing simple websites. With that, I take this opportunity to be able to make my very own portfolio to show what I have involved myself with online with the help of Bootstrap and GitHub Pages. The purpose of doing so is to express that even as a late enrollee, this is for me to be able to track and further expand my achievements, skills, goals, and status in the industry I wish to be further involved in.
 
 The Christian Salinas Website Portfolio is submitted as a final project requirement to CMSC 10 with Sir Jenmarc Muchada as the Instructor.
